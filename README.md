# Designing-Adder-Subtractor
A system that is capable of adding and subtracting two 3-bit binary numbers, A and B. The system accepts A, B, and an operator bit, O, which can either be 0 or 1, as input. If the bit O is 0 then the system adds A and B, and when O is 1 it subtracts B from A. In either case, the circuit generates the appropriate signals for seven-segment display to show the result of addition or subtraction as a hexadecimal digit. If the result is negative then the dp light of seven segment display is used to indicate that the displayed number is a negative number.
